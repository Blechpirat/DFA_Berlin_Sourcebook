Perfume shop where you can buy bottles of abstract concepts. Innocence, mercy, insight, empathy, inspiration, serendipity. And a spray does what's on the label.

Sniped and added. I'm pricing the bottles at one box of indebted per use. One use creates a scene aspect involving what's on the bottle :D

I had a faerie shop that traded in dreams. You could sell your nightmares (if they were interesting, basically, challenging the players to describe them in detail) for store credit, and buy restful or exciting dreams in exchange. If you were really lucky and had a lot of credit, the store owner occasionally got rarities like prophetic dreams or semi-lucid dreams that could teach you a skill. (Think Matrix: I know Kung-Fu).

You already have a magic ingredients shop, but make sure to sell some impossible ingredients, like for example in norse mythology, where dwarves make their unbreakable chain out of things like fish breath and spider's tears.

I've got a list of "street vendors". One of them is a fetch in a trench coat who will approach the PCs going, "you wanna buy some dreams?"

It will quickly go downhill from there :D

I figure that even faeries cannot resist the pull of unlimited bread sticks. Also it was just the most...ordinary...mass market restaurant I could think of.

Oh man, a store selling first borns. Not helpful, I know, but that is excellent!

What about a shop that sells secrets? Just random bits of secret knowledge, inventory of one. Or memories, maybe? Or a "drug" dealer that sells distillates of human emotion. Or a debt peddler.

EDIT: Or time! Buy years of life somehow, if you happen to not just be arbitrarily super long lived like wizards.

    The Memory Emporium:

A shop that buys, sells, and trades memories, with an ageless being as its shopkeeper. The store is filled with glowing vials containing memories, and the walls are adorned with intricate artwork depicting scenes from various recollections. The ageless being is a master of riddles and double entendres, often offering memories that seem valuable but have hidden drawbacks.

** Trap item:** A memory of a powerful spell or secret, but it turns out to be widely known or even a prank. ** Genuine items**: A memory containing the solution to a difficult puzzle or the location of a hidden treasure; A memory of a long-lost loved one, allowing the player to reconnect with their past. Unreasonable request: The shopkeeper asks for a player's most cherished memory in exchange for the desired memory.

    The Dreamweaver's Boutique:

A whimsical store that sells dreams and nightmares in various forms, such as bottled dreams or enchanted items that can induce specific dream experiences. The Dreamweaver, a silver-tongued fey, sits on a throne of pillows and silk, surrounded by shelves filled with shimmering dream jars. The fey offers dreams that seem to fulfill a player's deepest desires but may come with unexpected and unwanted side effects.

Trap item: A dream of ultimate power, which turns out to be a nightmare where the player is unable to control their newfound abilities, causing havoc. Genuine items: A dream that reveals a hidden talent or potential within the player; A dream that provides a clue to the next step in their adventure. Unreasonable request: The fey asks the player to bring them a rare, dangerous creature that feeds on dreams as payment for their purchase.

    The Timekeeper's Workshop:

This shop sells and repairs a wide variety of time-related items, such as hourglasses, sundials, and clocks. The Timekeeper, an enigmatic fey with an ever-shifting appearance, also offers time-manipulation services, like rewinding or fast-forwarding time, but at a hefty price. The shop is filled with ticking and whirring mechanisms, and the walls are adorned with celestial maps and time-related symbols.

Trap item: A pocket watch that promises to slow down time for the user, but it actually speeds up time for everyone else, leaving the user feeling rushed and disoriented. Genuine items: A timepiece that allows the player to briefly glimpse potential future outcomes of their actions; An hourglass that can temporarily halt time for a few moments, allowing the player to act without being noticed. Unreasonable request: The Timekeeper asks the player to pledge a portion of their remaining lifespan in exchange for a powerful time-related item or service.

    The Lost and Found Emporium:

This store is filled with items lost by their owners throughout the Nevernever and the mortal realm. The shopkeeper, a mischievous fey sprite with a sharp wit, delights in reuniting items with their rightful owners—or selling them to the highest bidder. The shop's shelves are cluttered with various objects, from misplaced keys to long-lost family heirlooms.

Trap item: A seemingly valuable artifact, which is actually cursed to bring misfortune to its possessor. Genuine items: A powerful magical item that has been lost for centuries; A sentimental trinket that holds great importance to one of the players. Unreasonable request: The sprite requests that the player steal a precious item from a rival fey lord in exchange for the desired object.

    The Pocket Dimension Emporium:

This store specializes in portable, pocket-sized dimensions for storage, travel, or even living spaces. The shopkeeper, an eccentric gnome fey with a talent for obfuscation, is always tinkering with new and exciting dimensional creations. The shop is filled with a variety of colorful orbs and enchanted containers, each holding a unique pocket dimension within.

Trap item: A pocket dimension that appears to be a perfect, safe haven but is actually a prison that is nearly impossible to escape. Genuine items: A small container that opens up into a spacious, extra-dimensional storage space; A magical doorway that allows players to instantly travel between two fixed locations. Unreasonable request: The gnome fey asks the player to deliver a mysterious package to a dangerous location, with the contents of the package remaining unknown.

    The Menagerie of Myth:

A fantastical pet store that sells all manner of magical creatures, from tiny dragon companions to majestic griffins. The store is run by a friendly, knowledgeable beastmaster fey who can provide guidance on proper care and training. The shop is filled with various habitats, each housing a unique magical creature.

-- Trap item: A seemingly docile creature that, once purchased, becomes uncontrollable and wreaks havoc. -- Genuine items: A loyal and intelligent magical creature that can aid the players in their quests; A rare creature with unique abilities that can be used to overcome obstacles. -- Unreasonable request: The beastmaster fey asks the player to capture and return a dangerous creature that has escaped from the shop in exchange for a discount on a desired pet.

    The Hall of Mirrors:

This store sells enchanted mirrors that can show different versions of reality, alternate dimensions, or even glimpses into the past or future. The shopkeeper, a mysterious figure always shrouded in shadows, warns that some mirrors may hold more than just reflections. The shop is filled with an array of mirrors in various shapes and sizes, casting a dizzying array of reflections around the room.

Trap item: A mirror that shows a desirable future outcome, but using the information provided by the mirror only leads to disaster. Genuine items: A mirror that reveals hidden secrets or hidden doors when gazed upon; A mirror that allows players to communicate with a specific individual from a distance. Unreasonable request: The mysterious fey asks the player to retrieve a powerful artifact from a dangerous location in exchange for a particularly rare or useful enchanted mirror.

    The Potion Pantry:

A shop that sells a vast array of potions, elixirs, and magical concoctions, each brewed by the skillful alchemist fey who owns the store. The shop is filled with bottles and vials of various shapes and sizes, neatly arranged on shelves that reach the ceiling. The alchemist fey is a charming and persuasive individual, always ready to convince customers of the merits of their creations.

Trap item: A potion that appears to grant incredible strength but actually causes uncontrollable muscle spasms and weakness. Genuine items: A potion that grants temporary invisibility; A healing elixir that can cure severe wounds or ailments. Unreasonable request: The alchemist fey asks the player to obtain a rare and dangerous magical ingredient, potentially putting the player in harm's way.

    The Enchanted Attire Atelier:

A boutique offering an assortment of magical garments and accessories, each crafted by the talented fey seamstress who runs the store. The shop is a dazzling array of colors and textures, with garments ranging from elegant gowns to sturdy adventuring gear. The seamstress fey is a master of flattery and persuasion, convincing customers of their need for her enchanting creations.

Trap item: A garment that appears to grant protection but actually attracts danger or enemies to the wearer. Genuine items: A cloak that grants the wearer the ability to blend into their surroundings, making them difficult to detect; A pair of boots that increase the wearer's speed and agility. Unreasonable request: The seamstress fey asks the player to steal a rival's unique and powerful enchanted garment in exchange for a custom creation.

    The Elemental Emporium:

A store that specializes in magical items and artifacts related to the elements—fire, water, earth, and air. The shopkeeper, a fey elemental mage, can manipulate the elements to create dazzling displays and demonstrate the power of the items for sale. The shop is divided into sections representing each element, with items like enchanted weapons, elemental stones, and talismans on display.

Trap item: An elemental stone that appears to grant the user control over a specific element, but instead, causes the element to become uncontrollable and destructive. Genuine items: A weapon imbued with elemental power, allowing the wielder to deal additional elemental damage; A talisman that grants the wearer resistance to a specific element. Unreasonable request: The elemental mage fey asks the player to retrieve a dangerous and volatile elemental artifact from a treacherous location in exchange for a powerful item.

    Strange Brew:

It's just a coffee shop. The proprietor is a 23-year old human woman, which is odd for a business run in fey lands. The biggest difference is that there are no high-pressure sales here, just typical Starbucks drink options and good wifi. There's one catch, however, like the other businesses in town, the coffee shop does not accept cash. Instead, a sign above the counter states that "all drinks cost one secret". The only requirement is that the secret must be genuine. Beyond that, being within the walls of the cafe will begin to impart a subtle feeling of anxiety and paranoia in the patrons within 10 minutes of their arrival, which can be counteracted by drinking any of the menu items, giving an immediate save to the effect that lasts 30 minutes. Imagine it like the opposite of a caffeine overdose. The interior is just like a human Starbucks.

I've got something like the memory emporium stuffed into "The Exchange". One of the goods that can be dealt in is memories, where secrets go at a major premium.

Dreams are dealt with in The Hall of Dreams. It's less a shop and closer to an art gallery run by a faerie simply named Nemo. The hall specializes in dream-related services beyond the basic walk-through viewing such as communications with specific individuals through their dreams (normally the viewable dreams are totally random). Phobophages are absolutely not allowed into the gallery.

Time Keeeper...stolen almost verbatium.

Lost and Found...shamelessly stolen almost verbatium. Added a line mentioning a LOT of left socks...

the hall of mirrors...I vamped on it a little.

The Halls of Mirrors: Two opposing mirror shops. Each one is an architectural reflection of the other, and each one has a similar inventory to the other. Only, one shop sells mirrors (enchanted mirrors, intelligent mirrors, portal mirrors, linked door mirrors, etc…) while the other sells prisons.

...and again, stolen :D The Enchanted Attire Atelier: A boutique offering an assortment of garments and accessories, each crafted by the talented fey seamstress who runs the store. The shop is a dazzling array of colors and textures with garments ranging from elegant gowns to sturdy adventuring gear. The center of the shop is dominated by a semi-circular array of tall mirrors surrounding a raised platform. Anyone (or anything) that stands on the raised platform will see themselves dressed in whatever they feel will make them look the best. Should the seamstress agree with their mental idea of style, anything they imagine can be easily created by the talented fey. Should she disagree with their vision of themselves, they will be find themselves magically transported outside.

This is a good idea.

I like to ask myself what does the Face of the shop want, need, etc...from anyone?

Why does anyone in the Nevernever run a shop (weird or otherwise)? Why are they seeking the "currency" they are requesting?

Example: Lurz, a skilled Boggin dentist, will gladly due your dental work (in one fourth the time as Boggins are renown for performing tasks at speed while no one is witnessing). In return, Lurz asks that in the future when you are finished with any tooth, you must place it under your pillow at night and do some chant that basically is a little ditty that alerts him to a new tooth (a'la the toothfaerie). Why? Well, Lurz doesn't actually care about your teeth, BUT Sugar'Rey sure does. You see Sugar'Rey collects teeth. Sugar'Rey needs new teeth so it can continue eating. Sugar'Rey is a powerful Redcap (renown for being able to safely consume anything it can eat) and it loves to fight the Outsiders and those that serve them. Sugar'Rey has discovered that when it eats teeth the better its ability to "consume anything" works. So, Sugar'Rey has two shops working: 1. A candy shop that has the best candy in all the lands.... But, every treat there is promised to cause some sort of tooth issue:Cavity, chipped teeth, pulled fillings....Not that they will tell you that, after all it is "common knowledge" that candy will rot your teeth. The price for this candy is cheap...easy to come by... Money, or secrets about his enemies, or TEETH from sharks, etc... Sugar'Rey wants easy teeth. 2. The second shop, a dentistry run by Lurz. Here, Sugar'Rey gets easy access to teeth. People literally just volunteer them up. But, break your vow and Sugar'Rey shows up to your house and actually beats every tooth from your face out.....and takes them.

Lurz's shop now has a story for being there and a reason for payment to be...teeth.

It also provides Sugar'Rey, the ability to continue doing his job as a faerie...Which is protect the world from Outsiders....while being a jerk to everyone else (bonus).

Now, you have two shops. LOL.

And, be honest... while reading this description.... Did you even stop to think that people who can and do make it to the Nevernever should already have the knowledge that you don't give up personal spell components to people... like blood, hair, skin....teeth... Do you believe your party will notice??? LOL.

What else could Sugar'Rey being doing with teeth. Especially a Wizard's tooth!

It also facilitates the concept behind why we leave teeth under a pillow etc... Sure Lurz and his toothfaeries leave a quarter or whatever that is...cause cash is nothing to these people and easy to come by.... But, perhaps the humans involved are unwittingly fulfilling a contract made by their ancestor long ago....

So...

Shop suggestion one: A candy shop, ah'la Harry Potter. Two: Lurz dental crafting.

And hey, it's a dental shop... Perhaps he can make you some fangs that work or graft some poison glands in there so you can have a poisonous bite. Anything a dentist can do (and a lot of things they cant) Lurz does it better and in one-fourth the time (which they knock you out for).

Good luck!
